Hi, Gaurav here - I am a Data Scientist at [Limbik](https://www.limbik.com/), where I'm leveraging Cognitive AI to proactively respond to misinformation!

As I inch towards my goal of becoming a full-stack Data Scientist, Iâ€™m always up to learn something new and work on cool projects. Currently, my interests include LLMs, MLOps, and Climate Tech.

While completing my undergraduate degree in [Management Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/management-engineering) at the University of Waterloo, the co-op program gave me exposure to data science and machine learning in various environments.

Apart from work, I spend my time playing football, lifting, and going on runs, while trying to brush up on my french.
